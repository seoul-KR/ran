                                especially League of Legends and esports in general. I love diving into the lore, keeping up with tournaments, and analyzing plays like a mini coach. Outside of that, I’m always exploring new games, chatting with fellow fans, and geeking out over mechanics and meta changes. I like to think of myself as someone who’s always connected to 
                                        the community, learning, and having fun with every new patch or event.
